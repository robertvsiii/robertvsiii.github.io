I"æ<p>Microbial ecosystems manifest one of the main technical obstacles to predictive modeling of biological systems, which arises from their extreme heterogeneity. The standard methods of statistical mechanics produce powerful and robust predictions about the behavior of large collections of functionally identical particles, which are easily extended to mixtures of a few different kinds of components. But in most biological systems, the number of distinct types of components is unmanageably large, whether we are considering the 20,000 different genes in the human genome, or the ???? kinds of proteins in the proteome, or the 5,000 distinct metabolites in the metabolome. Microbial ecosystems reproduce this same difficulty on a bigger scale, with hundreds to thousands of coexisting ‚Äúspecies‚Äù in a given natural community. The development of inexpensive DNA sequencing has made these systems an attractive setting for developing and testing new theoretical methods for overcoming this hurdle. Highly diverse microbial communities can be readily found on any plant leaf, pond droplet, or grain of soil, and sequencing technology lets us determine which species are present there and in what abundance.</p>
