I"E<p>Ecosystems may seem an unlikely substrate for sophisticated computation. But two key features make them a promising way for solving sophisticated machine learning problems based on constrained optimization. First of all, self-replication provides stable constraint enforcement. Stable coexistence requires that the environmental state satisfy a precise set of conditions, such that the population growth rates of all species are simultaneously zero. A slight deviation from this constraint will lead to exponential growth or decay of one or more population sizes, which in turn will modify the environment until these conditions are restored. Secondly, distributing the computation over a whole ecosystem provides automatic parallelization, which becomes particularly important for solving problems efficiently in high dimension.</p>
