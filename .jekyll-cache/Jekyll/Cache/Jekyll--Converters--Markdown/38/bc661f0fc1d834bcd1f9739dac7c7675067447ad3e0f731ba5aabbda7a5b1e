I"Û<p><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington">Sir Arthur Eddington</a> famously remarked that the Second Law of Thermodynamics holds â€œthe supreme position among the laws of Nature.â€ Half a century earlier, Ludwig Boltzmann had already noted that thermodynamics constrains the activity of living systems, in such a way that the Darwinian â€œstruggle for existenceâ€ could be framed in terms of entropy. Recent progress in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics has opened up new possibilities for fleshing out these insights, determining which features of biological activity are constrained by thermodynamic laws, and what the â€œnegative entropyâ€ obtained in the â€œstruggle for existenceâ€ is used for.</p>
