I"<p>The concept of a “species” is notoriously ill-defined in the microbial realm. Instead of the sharp distinctions between different kinds of plants and animals we find in the macroscopic world, microbes manifest a fuzzier continuum of phenotypes. Given this blurriness, it should come as no surprise that it is difficult to predict “species”-level composition of microbial communities. But natural microbial communities do have sufficiently stable functional properties to be effectively utilized by macroscopic organisms to accomplish definite tasks. This means that there should be some community-level quantities that are reproducible and controllable, and some “relevant variables” that reliably control them, but what these quantities could be remains an open question.</p>
