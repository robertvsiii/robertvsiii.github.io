I"<<p>One of the distinctive features of living matter is the presence of self-sustaining metabolic reaction networks. Every time a cell divides, it must take in chemical compounds available in its environment, and use them to double the quantity of each internal molecular species. General properties of such collectively autocatalytic reaction networks have been studied for many decades, but the rise of biosphere-scale databases of biochemical reactions has created new avenues for working out the necessary conditions for the spontaneous emergence of such networks.</p>
