I am a Catholic priest of the [Prelature of Opus Dei][opusdei] currently pursuing a Doctorate in Sacred Theology at the [Pontifical University of the Holy Cross][pusc] in Rome, Italy, while providing pastoral care to members of Opus Dei and participants in their apostolates in Dallas, Texas. Previously, I spent ten years doing research in statistical physics, thermodynamics and biophysics: first as an undergraduate running experiments on spin-velocity correlations of optically pumped atoms in the laboratory of William Happer at Princeton, then as a graduate student developing theories in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics with [Jeremy England][jeremy] at MIT, and finally as a postdoc with [Pankaj Mehta][pankaj] at Boston University, where I applied insights from statistical physics and machine learning to the analysis of complex ecosystems. At the moment, this site is focused primarily on my postdoctoral research, and is designed as a convenient entry point for anyone interested in exploring and building on this work. For more recent theological writing, see my [Substack][walden].
