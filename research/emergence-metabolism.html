    <p>One of the distinctive features of living matter is the presence of self-sustaining metabolic reaction networks. Every time a cell divides, it must take in chemical compounds available in its environment, and use them to double the quantity of each internal molecular species. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalytic_set">General properties of such collectively autocatalytic reaction networks</a> have been studied for many decades, but the rise of <a href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/">biosphere-scale databases of biochemical reactions</a> has created new avenues for working out the necessary conditions for the spontaneous emergence of such networks.</p>

<p>My coauthors and I have shown how large and complex self-sustaining reaction networks could have spontaneously arisen in a variety of proposed pre-biotic geochemical scenarios, before the emergence of nitrogen-fixing or phosphate-fixing enzymes <a href="#goldford2018boundary">(Goldford, Hartman, Marsland, &amp; Segre, Preprints)</a>. I have been investigating the properties of collectively autocatalytic sub-networks in some of these scenarios, and am interested in applying methods from the physics of disordered systems to study the similarities and differences between these real sub-networks and the autocatalytic portions of random networks.</p>
