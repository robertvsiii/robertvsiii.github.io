One of the distinctive features of living matter is the presence of self-sustaining metabolic reaction networks. Every time a cell divides, it must take in chemical compounds available in its environment, and use them to double the quantity of each internal molecular species. [General properties of such collectively autocatalytic reaction networks][kauffman] have been studied for many decades, but the rise of [biosphere-scale databases of biochemical reactions][kegg] has created new avenues for working out the necessary conditions for the spontaneous emergence of such networks.

My coauthors and I have shown how large and complex self-sustaining reaction networks could have spontaneously arisen in a variety of proposed pre-biotic geochemical scenarios, before the emergence of nitrogen-fixing or phosphate-fixing enzymes {% cite goldford2018boundary %}. I have been investigating the properties of collectively autocatalytic sub-networks in some of these scenarios, and am interested in applying methods from the physics of disordered systems to study the similarities and differences between these real sub-networks and the autocatalytic portions of random networks.
